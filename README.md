## 🧠 Overview

Welcome to the **Vishnu CNN** repository. This project explores the fascinating world of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **Deep Learning Architecture**: Comprehensive implementations of standard CNN layers (Convolution, Pooling, Fully Connected).
-   **Image Classification**: State-of-the-art models for classifying images with high accuracy.
-   **Transfer Learning**: Utilization of pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG, and Inception.
-   **Data Augmentation**: Robust pipelines to enhance dataset diversity and prevent overfitting.
-   **Visualization Tools**: Scripts to visualize feature maps, filters, and training metrics.

## 📚 What is a CNN?

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.

### Core Components:

1.  **Convolutional Layer**: The core building block that extracts features from the input image.
2.  **Pooling Layer**: Reduces the spatial size of the Convolved Feature to reduce the computational power required.
3.  **Fully Connected Layer**: Used to classify the image based on the features extracted by the previous layers.
